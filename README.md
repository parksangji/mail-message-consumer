This Spring Boot application is designed to consume messages from Kafka topics related to email and various text-based notifications (e.g., KakaoTalk, SMS). Upon receiving a message, it processes the corresponding logic for each type of notification.

## Key Features

* **Kafka Consumer**: Listens to specified Kafka topics for mail and message events.
* **Message Handling**: Processes messages based on their type (email or text).
* **Extensible**: Designed to easily integrate new notification channels.
* **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of message processing and potential errors.
* **Database Integration**: Records the history of sent emails and messages.
* **Resilience**: Implements retry mechanisms for external service calls.
* **Scalability**: Leverages Spring Boot and Kafka for scalable message consumption.
* **Monitoring**: Includes Spring Boot Actuator for application monitoring.
* **Containerization**: Dockerfile included for easy containerization and deployment.

## Technologies Used

* **Java**: Programming language.
* **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the application.
* **Spring for Apache Kafka**: Integration with Kafka.
* **Lombok**: Reduces boilerplate code.
* **Spring Data JPA**: For database interaction.
* **PostgreSQL**: Database used for logging.
* **Spring Mail**: For sending emails.
* **RestTemplate**: For interacting with external message APIs (e.g., Kakao, SMS).
* **Spring Retry**: For implementing retry mechanisms.
* **Spring Actuator**: For monitoring and management endpoints.
* **JUnit**: For unit and integration testing.
* **Mockito**: For mocking dependencies in tests.
* **Embedded Kafka**: For integration testing of Kafka consumers.
* **Docker**: For containerization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher.
* Maven or Gradle (depending on your project setup).
* A running Kafka instance.
* PostgreSQL database.
* (Optional) Accounts and configurations for external messaging services (e.g., Kakao API, SMS gateway).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-github-username/mail-message-consumer.git](https://github.com/your-github-username/mail-message-consumer.git)
    cd mail-message-consumer
    ```

2.  **Build the application using Maven:**
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```
    Or using Gradle:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean build
    ```

3.  **Configure the application:**
    * Create an `application.properties` or `application.yml` file in the `src/main/resources` directory.
    * Configure Kafka bootstrap servers, consumer group ID, database connection details, mail server settings, external API URLs, etc. (Refer to the `application.properties` example provided earlier).

### Running the Application

Using Maven:
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
Using Gradle:

Bash

./gradlew bootRun
Configuration
The application's behavior is configured through the application.properties or application.yml file. Key configurations include:

Kafka: Bootstrap servers, consumer group ID, topic names.
Database: JDBC URL, username, password, driver.
Mail: Host, port, username, password.
External APIs: URLs and any necessary credentials.
Logging: Levels and patterns.
Spring Retry: Configuration for retry attempts and backoff.
Spring Actuator: Management endpoints and health checks.
